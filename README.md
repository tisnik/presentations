### Assembler

Demonstration examples for the assembly language. Most examples are written
for the i386 and x86-64 architectures, but some programs have been ported
to other architectures as well, especially for ARM(32), PowerPC, and s390.

### Love

Examples that are written in Lua and use the LÖVE framework that can be found
on the following address [https://love2d.org/](https://love2d.org/).

### Pygame

Various curves (including implicit and parametric curves) computed and
visualized via Python + Matplotlib

### Fractals

Examples from the article serie about fractals

### Rust

Demonstration example for the Rust programming language.
