# Importance of notations and the APL programming language

## Notations

* notation is a system of
    - graphics or symbols
    - characters
    - abbreviated expressions

* a collection of related symbols
    - that are each given an arbitrary meaning
    - created to facilitate structured communication
    - within a domain knowledge or field of study!

* symbols
    - mark, sign, word
    - indication
    - is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship
    - pictorial/associative/abstract/conceptual
    - stop sign, arrow

### Why?

* human brain is excellent in recognizing patterns
* and can be train to recognize new set of patterns
* **Notation as a tool of thought**

### Examples of notations

* Music notation
* Chemistry notations (a lot of in fact)
* Chess moves notation
* Feynman diagrams
* etc.

#### Chess moves notation

```
♘f3 ♞c6
♗xc6 dxc6
0-0 ♝xc3
```

## Classic programming languages

* i.e. almost all languages with some exceptions
* most are based on "1.5D" text flow
   - from left to right
   - from top to bottom
* usually just basic ASCII characters are used

### Exceptions

* Fortress
    - rendered via LaTeX
* Algol 68 Report
    - ∧, ∨
    - ×, ÷, ÷×, ÷*, %×
    - ≤, ≥, ≠, ¬=
    - →, ○, ¢, ⏨, □
    - ×:=, ÷:=, ÷×:=, ÷*:=,  %×:=
    - ¬, ↑, ↓, ⌊, ⌈, ⊥
    - ⊂, ≡, ␣, ⊃, ⎩, ⎧
* Epigram
    - "2D" blocks
    - rendered via LaTeX

### Examples

#### Algol

```algol
¢ this is a comment
real avogadro = 6.0221415⏨23
```

#### Epigram

```epigram
     (         !       (          !   (  n : Nat  !
data !---------! where !----------! ; !-----------!
     ! Nat : * )       !zero : Nat)   !suc n : Nat)
```

![Epigram1](images/notation_epigram1.png)

```
plus x y <= rec x {
  plus x y <= case x {
    plus zero y => y
    plus (suc x) y => suc (plus x y)
  }
}
```

## APL programming language

* "A Programming Language"
    - impossible to come with shorter term :)

### Origins of APL

* Kenneth E. Iverson
* it was invented as new form of mathematical notation
* during his work for IBM (yes, IBM!) it was translater into aprogramming language
* in 1979, Iverson received the Turing Award for his work on APL
* "A shocking brevity"
* Common idioms are to be recognized in no time
    - like quadratic formula
* later IBM discouraged customers from using it
    - (but was used a lot by many IBM departments at the same time)
    - prefer to use languages based on "methodologies"
    - basically to split design, analytics, development, and testing
    - OTOH IBM was almost never good at PL design
* btw how to made money
    - $1 for one CPU second
    - $1 for 1kB of output

### Kenneth E. Iverson

* IBM Fellow, IBM, 1970
* Harry H. Goode Memorial Award, IEEE Computer Society, 1975
* Member, National Academy of Engineering (USA), 1979
* Turing Award, Association for Computing Machinery, 1979
* Computer Pioneer Award (Charter recipient), IEEE Computer Society, 1982
* Honorary doctorate, York University, 1998

### "Array languages"

* An array:
    - rectangular collection of numbers, characters and arrays
    - arranged along zero or more axes

### APL today
* APL developers
    - any kind of engineer other than a software engineer
    - do not feel comfortable discussing "programming"
    - i.e. not visible much on SO etc.
    - they generally hate software fashion waves
    - (Dyalog CTO Morten Kromberg)
* Fintec
    - Realtime trading
* Insurance companies
* Big data processing

## Feel of APL

* Operators (function-like)

```
      monadic               dyadic
+     identity              addition
-     negation              subtraction
×     sign                  multiplication
÷     1/x                   division
ι     counter
⌹     matrix inversion      matrix division
⍉     matrix transposition
⌽     reverse               rotation
/                           reduce
.                           inner product
◦.                          outer product
```

* Expression

```apl
1+2×3
```

* From right to left, no priorities

```apl
2×3+1
```

* Vectors

```apl
⍴ 1 2 3 4

VECTOR ← 1 2 3 4 5 6
⍴VECTOR

EMPTY_LIST ← ι0

VECTOR[3]
VECTOR[1 3 5]

'xenobiotic'[10 10 1]
```

* Vector containing 1, 2, 3, 4 .. 10

```
ι10
```

* Item-by-item operations

```apl
÷1 2 3 4 5
10÷1 2 3 4 5
```

* Reduce operator

```apl
+/ 1 2 3 4
```

* Calculate the sum of all integers ranging from 1 to 100

```apl
+/ι100
```

* Factorial computation

```apl
*/ι100
```

* Factorial function

```apl
fact←{×/⍳⍵}
```

* Average

```apl
X ← 1 2 3 4 5
(+/X)÷⍴X
```

* Scan operator
    - like reduce, but returns all intermediate results

```apl
+\ 1 2 3 4 5
```

* Factorial 1! to 10!

```apl
×\⍳10
```

* Take and drop functions

```apl
list ← ι10
1 ↑ list
1 ↓ list
```

* Absolute and relative change computation
```apl
revenues ← 56 59 67 64 60 61 68 73 78 75 81 84
(1↓revenues)-(¯1↓revenues)
100×((1↓revenues)÷(¯1↓revenues))-1
```

* Matrices

```apl
4 3 ⍴ ⍳12

Mat ← 3 3 ρ ι 9
Mat[2;2]
```

* Outer product
     - very powerful operation

```apl
(⍳5)∘.×(⍳5)
(⍳5)∘.=(⍳5)
(⍳5)∘.<(⍳5)
(⍳5)∘.≥(⍳5)
```
