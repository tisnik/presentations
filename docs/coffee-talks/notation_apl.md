# Notations and the APL programming language

## Notations

* notation is a system of
    - graphics or symbols
    - characters
    - abbreviated expressions

* a collection of related symbols
    - that are each given an arbitrary meaning
    - created to facilitate structured communication
    - within a domain knowledge or field of study!

* symbols
    - mark, sign, word
    - indication
    - is understood as representing an idea, object, or relationship
    - pictorial/associative/abstract/conceptual
    - stop sign, arrow

### Why?

* human brain is excellent in recognizing patterns
* and can be train to recognize new set of patterns

### Examples of notations

*

## Classic programming languages

* i.e. almost all languages with some exceptions

## APL programming language

* "A Programming Language"
    - impossible to come with shorter term :)

### Origins of APL

* Kenneth E. Iverson
* it was invented as new form of mathematical notation
* during his work for IBM (yes, IBM!) it was translater into aprogramming language
* in 1979, Iverson received the Turing Award for his work on APL
