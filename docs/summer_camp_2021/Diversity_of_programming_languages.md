# Diversity of programming languages

## Paradigmas

* Imperative
    - Procedural
    - Object-oriented
* Declarative
    - Functional
    - Logic
    - Dataflow
* Metaprogramming
* Array-oriented
etc.

## Abstraction level

* Levels from the real HW
    - 5   applications
    - 4Â½  (scripting languages, VM-based languages)
    - 4   C-like languages
    - 3   assembler
    - 2   machine code
    - 1   syscalls
    - 0   HW

## Technological differences

* Interpreters
* Compilers
* Transpilers
* "Blended" approach

## Historical view (simplified)

* FORTRAN
    - ad-hoc compiler
    - semi-procedural language
    - no truly recursive
* Algol
    - compiler based on quite good theory
    - procedural, structured
    - recursive
* Pascal, Modula
    - loosely based on Algol
    - simpler and faster one-pass compilers!
