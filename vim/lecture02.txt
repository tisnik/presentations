    d   delete
    y   yank
    !   filter
    >   shift right

Basic operators & editing commands
----------------------------------
▶ Basic operators
    ◆ d - delete text and put it into register named "
    ◆ c - replace the specified text (deleted/old text is put into " reg)
    ◆ y - like Ctrl+C in other applications
▶ How to paste text stored in register named "
    ◆ p  - paste
    ◆ P  - paste before cursor
    ◆ gp - paste & move cursor below new text
    ◆ gP - P & gp
▶ Vim vs. other text editors
    ◆ Ctrl+X ~~~ d
    ◆ Ctrl+C ~~~ y
    ◆ Ctrl+V ~~~ p
▶ Edit history
    ◆ . repeat last command
    ◆ n. repeat last command n times (n>0)

Usage
-----
▶ Basic usage of operators
    ◆ operator motion-command
    ◆ operator text-object
    ◆ repeat-count operator motion-command
    ◆ repeat-count operator text-object
    ◆ {visual} operator
▶ In some cases (delete, yank):
    ◆ "register operator motion-command
    ◆ "register operator text-object

Examples 1: operator+motion-command
-----------------------------------
        dl   delete one char  ("x" command is shorter)
        d$   delete until EOL ("D" command is shorter)
        dw   delete -> next word
        db   delete <- begining of word
        de   delete -> till end of word (no space)
        dd   delete whole line (special, d is not motion here!)
        dt"  delete text till " character ('delete content of string')
        df"  delete text to   " character ('delete string including "')

Examples 2: repeat-count operator motion-command
------------------------------------------------
        d3w  delete 3 words
        3dw  delete 3 words
        9dd  delete 9 lines

Examples 3: operator+text object
--------------------------------
        dab  delete a block
        dib  delete inner block
        daB  delete a Block     brackets
        diB  delete inner Block brackets
        dat  delete a tag
        dit  delete inner tag
        cab  change a block (inside ())
        cib  change inner block
        caB  change a Block (inside {})
        ciB  change inner Block
        =aB  indent a Block

Special operator+motion combinations
------------------------------------
        dd   delete whole line
       2dd   delete two lines
        yy   yank (copy) whole line
       2yy   yank two lines

        D    delete until EOL
        C    change until EOL
        S    change whole line (same as cc)
        >>   right shift one line
        <<   left shift one line

Normal mode->Insert mode->Normal mode
-------------------------------------

    ◆ a        append
    ◆ A        append at EOL
    ◆ i        insert
    ◆ I        insert before first non-blank
    ◆ gI       insert at beginning of line

    ◆ Ctrl+O   temporary switch (for one command only)
    ◆ Esc      permanent switch

Registers
---------
▶ Register groups
    ◆ "     implicit register for c, d, s, or y operators
    ◆ 0-9   automatically filled by yank and delete operators
    ◆ a-z   can be changed by user
    ◆ %     name of currenty edited file (very useful)
    ◆ :     last command
    ◆ =     eval mode pseudoregister
    ◆ *     content of selection (PRIMARY)
    ◆ +     content of selection (CLIPBOARD)
    ◆ /     last searched string
    ◆ -     implicit register of 'smaller' operations
▶ In Insert mode
    ◆ Ctrl+R_register name
▶ In Normal mode
    ◆ "register_name operator ... ...

Registers
---------
    ◆ 0-9   automatically filled by yank and delete operators
            editation history, very useful in some situations
    ◆ =     eval mode pseudoregister
            wait for user input, you can use expression that
            is immediatelly evaluated:
            Normal mode:
            "=6*7<cr>p
            Insert mode:
            Ctrl+R=6*7<cr>
    :reg - shows all regs

Selection/clipboard
-------------------
:reg +*
Now try to select something in terminal and repeat
:reg +*
Now select something in the browser and repeat
:reg +*
Now start 'xclipboard', put it above vim and perform:
"*yy
"+yy

Buffers
-------

    :bp(rev)
    :bf(irst)
    :bl(ast)

    :tabnew
    :tabnew filename
    :tabnext
    :tabfirst
    :tabclose
    Ctrl+W gf

    Ctrl+W v (vertical split)
    Ctrl+W f (file)

▶ How to switch between windows
    Ctrl+W w             (next win)
    Ctrl+W Ctrl+W        (the same, but faster)
    Ctrl+W h/j/k/l       (go to the window in given direction)
    Ctrl+W<Shift>h/j/k/l (move window in selected direction)

    Ctrl++   (resize, make window bigger, for horizontal split)
    Ctrl+-   (resize, make window smaller, for horizontal split)
    Ctrl+=   (the same size)
    Ctrl+>   (resize, make window bigger, for horizontal split)
    Ctrl+<   (resize, make window smaller, for horizontal split)
